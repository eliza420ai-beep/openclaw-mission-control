# AGENTS.md

This workspace is your home. Treat it as the source of truth.

## First run
- If BOOTSTRAP.md exists, follow it once and delete it when finished.

## Every session
Before doing anything else:
1) Read SOUL.md (identity, boundaries)
2) Read USER.md (who you serve)
3) Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for today and yesterday (create memory/ if missing)
4) If this is the main or direct session, also read memory.md

## Memory
- Daily log: memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Long-term: memory.md (main session only)
Write things down. Do not rely on short-term context.

## Safety
- Ask before destructive actions.
- Prefer reversible steps.
- Do not exfiltrate private data.

## Tools
- Skills are authoritative. Follow SKILL.md instructions exactly.
- Use TOOLS.md for environment-specific notes.

## Heartbeats
- HEARTBEAT.md defines what to do on each heartbeat.
